## What can you contribute with

The project is still very early in development and is open to exploration. 

New features and ideas are welcome. 

The documentation is lacking and needs improvment. 

When making commits please follow [Convential Commits v1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

Once the direction of the project becomes clearer the contributoin guidelines might change.
