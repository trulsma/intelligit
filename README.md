## How does it work
Intelligit uses [patterns](docs/PATTERN.md) to find meaningful symbols in the source code and tracks changes in the symbols.
The patterns use [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter).

todo: Better explanation

## Installing

Using a pattern requires having the tree-sitter parser compiled. Intelligit will clone and compile the tree-sitter parser but requires that a c compiler is installed.

## Project Status
Intelligit is currently in its early stages of development, and the project's direction is open to exploration.
